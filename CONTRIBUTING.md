Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Amazon Kinesis Hot Shard Advisor (KHS)! üíñ

This document describes how to set up a development environment and submit your contributions.
Please read it over and let us know if it's not up-to-date (or, even better, submit a PR with your corrections üòâ).

## Development setup

### Environment

- Make sure you are using Go 1.18 (`go version`).
- Fork the repository.
- Clone your forked repository locally.
- We use Go Modules to manage dependencies, so you can develop outside of your $GOPATH.

#### Set upstream

From the repository root run:

`git remote add upstream git@github.com:awslabs/kinesis-hot-shard-advisor`

`git fetch upstream`

### Building and testing

**Unit tests** makes up the majority of the testing and new code should include unit tests.
Ideally, these unit tests will be in the same package as the file they're testing and have full coverage (or as much is practical within a unit test).
Unit tests shouldn't make any network calls.

* Run `make` (This creates a standalone executable in the `build/khs` directory).
* Run `make test` to run the unit tests.

## Adding new dependencies

In general, we discourage adding new dependencies to the KHS. If there's a module you think the CLI could benefit from, first open a PR with your proposal.
We'll evaluate the dependency and the use case and decide on the next steps. To evaluate if we need to add the dependency please take a look at [https://research.swtch.com/deps](https://research.swtch.com/deps).

## Where should I start?

We're so excited you want to contribute to KHS! We welcome all PRs and will try to get to them as soon as possible.
The best place to start, though, is with filing an issue first. Filing an issue gives us some time to chat about the code you're keen on writing, and make sure that it's not already being worked on, or has already been discussed.

You can also check out our [issues queue](https://github.com/awslabs/kinesis-hot-shard-advisor/issues) to see all the known issues - this is a really great place to start.

If you want to get your feet wet, check out issues tagged with [good first issue](https://github.com/aws/kinesis-hot-shard-advisor/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
These issues are great for folks who are looking to get started, but not sure where to start üòÅ.

## Contributing code
* Please check the existing issues to see if your feedback has already been reported.

* Let us know if you are interested in working on an issue by leaving a comment
on the issue in GitHub. This helps avoid multiple people unknowingly working on
the same issue.

* If you would like to propose a new feature, please open an issue on GitHub with
a detailed description. This enables us to collaborate on the feature design
more easily and increases the chances that your feature request will be accepted.

* New features should include full test coverage.

* New files should include the standard license  header.

* All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more
information on using pull requests.
